'''
1. Key word cannot be identifier.
2. All identifier are case-sensitive.
3. Identifier cannot start with number it only start with Letters and under score(_).Underscore consider as a letter to identifer.

Examples 
1. 
print = 50 . print is the keyword.
2.
name= "moni"  | Both are acceptable because both are case- sensitive.
Name = "siva" | name and Name are different according to program Language.
3.
_ = "god" | this one is acceptable because underscore consider as letter
4name= "god" | this cannot be acceptable because it cannot start with number to identifer.
